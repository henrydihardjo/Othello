## Reversi AI Project

### Student
Henry Dihardjo - dihardjo@seattleu.edu  
Ian Suwandi    - suwandii@seattleu.edu 

### What is it?
This will be an implementation of the game reversi where you can face the computer or watch two artifical intelligences agaisnt each other.  
We are going to use the Minimax algorithm in maximizing the best moves for the reversi AI. The minimax provides a way of looking multiple moves ahead, maximizing the AI's score while minimizing the opponent's score. It is a recursive algorithm that will repeteadly evaluates scores over time.
